# IoT-based-home-appliances-control-system
This was the final year project during my undergraduate degree in the year 2018. The project uses mobile application (Blynk) to monitor data from sensors: DHT 11(temperature and humidity), LDR(light intensity), HC-SR04(ultrasonic range), control home appliances: fan, light, water-pump, and show smart emergency notification (automatically turn off the appliance on a specified condition with a message to the user). NodeMCU Esp8266 12E was used for collecting data from sensors and sending the same to Blynk server, and on the use of buttons in Blynk app signals were sent from app through NodeMCU to control the actuators. The code was written in Arduino IDE.
The circuit diagram, list of components, working principle and results are available in my research publication on [IoT-based home appliances control system using NodeMCU and Blynk server](https://iarjset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IARJSET-3.pdf)
The project report has a more detailed explanation of the different parts of the project and the overall budget of this implemented model.

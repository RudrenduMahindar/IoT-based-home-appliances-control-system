# IoT-based-home-appliances-control-system
This was the final year project during my undergraduate degree in the year 2018. The project uses mobile application (Blynk) to monitor data from sensors: DHT 11(temperature and humidity), LDR(light intensity), HC-SR04(ultrasonic range), control home appliances: fan, light, water-pump, and show smart emergency notification (automatically turn off the appliance on a specified condition with a message to the user). The circuit diagram, list of components and working principle is available in (IoT-based home appliances control system using NodeMCU and Blynk server) [https://iarjset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IARJSET-3.pdf].

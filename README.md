# IoT-based-home-appliances-control-system
This was the final year project during my undergraduate degree in the year 2018. The project uses mobile application (Blynk) to monitor data from sensors: DHT 11(temperature and humidity), LDR(light intensity), HC-SR04(ultransonic range)  and control home appliances: fan, light, water-pump, and smart emergency notification feature(automatically turn off the appliance on a specified condition with a message to the user). Here is the link to my paper published in IARJSET: https://iarjset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IARJSET-3.pdf
